Prerequisites
-------------
As of BlueZ version 5.43 (currently shipped with Raspbian Stretch),
some BLE aspects are still experimental. You will need to add the
'Experimental' flag to the bluetooth daemon. Do this:
    sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/dbus-org.bluez.service
and add the '-E' flag at the end of the 'ExecStart' line. It should
look like this:

    ExecStart=/usr/lib/bluetooth/bluetoothd -E

Save the file and reboot.

## Dependencies

Install `dbus` module:
```
sudo apt-get install python3-dbus
```


Installation 
------------
    git clone https://github.com/douglas6/cputemp.git
    cd cputemp

Usage 
----- 
    python3 cputemp.py

The server should by accessable by any BLE client; I like to use
the 'nRF Connect' app on my Android phone.

The service (UUID 00000001-710e-4a5b-8d75-3e5b444b3c3f) provides 
two characteristics:

UUID 00000002-710e-4a5b-8d75-3e5b444b3c3f: a read/notify
characteristic representing the Pi's CPU temperature as a string.

UUID 00000003-710e-4a5b-8d75-3e5b444b3c3f: a read/write
characteristic indicating the units to use to display the
temperature; 'F' or 'C'.
